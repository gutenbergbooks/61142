<p class="ph2">THE ELECTRIC MAN.</p>


<p>The three act successful farcical comedy, &#8220;The Electric
Man,&#8221; which may be obtained in manuscript from Messrs.
Samuel French, Ltd., was first presented at the King&#8217;s
Theatre, Hammersmith, with Mr. Harcourt Beatty in the
leading rôle, and was subsequently put on for a West End
run at the Royalty Theatre on November 10, 1906, with Mr.
Harry Nicholls as the Electric Man, the piece being transferred
to the Shaftesbury Theatre on Boxing Day of the same
year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The condensed one act form of the play which follows was
produced by Mr. Harry Nicholls at the Chelsea Palace and
Metropolitan Halls with the greatest success on July 29,
1907, cast thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NOTES.</p>

<p>Walter and the automaton are never upon the stage
together, so that throughout the play Walter takes the
figure&#8217;s place by entering the cupboard &#8220;off.&#8221; A super is
required, however, to play &#8220;dummy,&#8221; but when this happens
the figure is seated in the cupboard with its back to audience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Costume</span> for Walter and for the automaton: Walter
wears a brown coat or jacket and trousers of the same, with
a white waistcoat. The automaton is dressed exactly the
same as to trousers and waistcoat, etc., but wears a black
frock coat, and as they both usually keep the coat buttoned,
the waistcoat is seldom seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Funeral March of a Marionette</i>&#8221; to accompany the automaton&#8217;s
scenes. The automaton walks very stiffly and
jerkily, and moves his arms like a doll.</p>

<p><i>The cupboard door has a spring so that it closes of itself
when left open, a string being also tacked across the
inside of the door so that</i> <span class="smcap">Walter</span> <i>can pull the door

young gent isn&#8217;t up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>looks at his watch</i>). Was he late last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Anderson</span>. Oh, yes, sir, as I happens to
know being woked up sudden, thinkering to hear a
burgular, which was only Master Walter Everest, the
gent I does for, a-creepering and a-crawlering upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Is he often like that? (<i>Takes up and
looks at letters on table and puts them down again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Anderson.</span> Lawk a floury! no, sir, only
breaks out occasional when his work&#8217;s bad. Mr.
Everest is a chemist and electerician.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Been working hard lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Anderson.</span> I believes as he have something
very musterious and secret inventering at this here
identical period of time, some mustery as he keeps in
that there cupboard which the door is always locked
constant. Oh, very musterious&mdash;and queer smells
a-penetratering and perfuncteroring the house. Oh,
here he are, sir.</p>



<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Walter&#8217;s</span> <i>door</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>opens</i>. <i>She exits</i> <span class="smcap">D.</span> <i>in</i> <span class="smcap">F.</span>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Walter</span> <i>stumbles in</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>He is not to look dissipated,

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Hullo, hullo! whose head is this? It
isn&#8217;t mine, it can&#8217;t be mine. Stop! (<i>Sits top of</i>
<span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>table</i>.) Stop! (<i>Picks up newspaper.</i>) Morning
paper, who wants morning paper? (<i>Throws it on
floor behind him, and</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span>, <i>who is watching him, picks
it up</i>. <span class="smcap">Walter</span> <i>opens letter</i>.) Letters, who wants
letters?&mdash;oh, one from my tailor, &#8220;We greatly regret
delay in delivery of your new black coat. We will
despatch it to reach your residence without fail to-day.
May we remind you that your account&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
No, you may <i>not</i> remind me.</p>



<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>gives him a rousing smack on the back</i>.)</p>

<p>Hullo, Jack, where did you spring from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Came to town this morning. (<i>Clasp hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Jack, I&#8217;m very ill. I haven&#8217;t been out
of doors till last night for weeks. Nothing but work
at what my father left me. He gave <i>his</i> lifetime to it
and then left it to me. It ought to have been the
invention of the age. I went on the spree last night,
when the whole thing failed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> I have some news for you about your stepmother,
Mrs. Everest. By the idiotic conditions of
your late father&#8217;s will&mdash;if the old lady marries again
before your birthday on Monday next the whole
fortune he left becomes not yours but hers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> He meant it the other way about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Yes, but that is how the will reads&mdash;instead
of writing &#8220;<i>He</i> shall inherit,&#8221; your father wrote
&#8220;<i>she</i> shall inherit.&#8221; She is the &#8220;she.&#8221; About
forty-five thou., isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Nearer fifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> An adventurer named Potterfield has
lately come to the village, found out about the will,
made love to the old lady, got a special license, and
is bringing her to town to marry her to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Stella is coming here directly. This wedding
must be stopped or postponed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Jack, something&#8217;s got to be done&mdash;suppose
I were taken ill&mdash;very ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> No good at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Well, suppose that&mdash;no, that&#8217;s no use&mdash;suppose
again that&mdash;no, that&#8217;s no good either. I
have a dim kind of idea that in some way my invention
is going to help us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> You said it had failed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> It failed living; it might be of use dead.
(<i>Swiss Jodel.</i>) Hullo, tra la la! (<i>Momentary dissipated
business.</i>)</p>


<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Stella</span> <i>enters</i> <span class="smcap">D.</span> <i>in</i> <span class="smcap">F.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Hullo, Stella how are you? Jack has told
me all about this adventurer, Potterfield. I&#8217;ve
an idea to checkmate my stepmother. (<i>Gives
her seat.</i>) I&#8217;m going to postpone their marriage not
by being ill&mdash;I&#8217;m going to die. What do you think
of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> I think it&#8217;s the weakest thing I ever heard
of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> In that cupboard there is a figure exactly
like myself which was timed to spring into existence
yesterday at 5 p.m.&mdash;only it didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s the work
my father never completed. Something went wrong.
There the figure is and will remain, dead as a nut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
I even dressed it in my best clothes, gave it a name,
too, christened it Cyril Davidson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stella.</span> Cyril Davidson? (<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> What was the little idea of making it like
yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> My father&#8217;s instructions were to make
the man I was creating a handsome, good-looking
fellow, according to the very best available model.
All you&#8217;ve got to do is to produce the dead figure and
say it&#8217;s me. I&#8217;ll go away to Brighton; they can&#8217;t in
common decency marry before the funeral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Then it seems you made an electric man.
<i>My</i> chief doubt is it won&#8217;t be like enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Come and see!</p>



<p class="center">(<i>Music. He takes key from pocket, unlocks door of
cupboard, and a man in black frock-coat, with black
bowler, is seen seated with back to audience.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stella.</span> Oh, how wonderful! (<i>Looking in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Wonderful! (<i>Looking in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stella.</span> Walter, that <i>is</i> you!</p>


<p class="center">(<i>Bell rings off</i> <span class="smcap">D.</span> <i>in</i> <span class="smcap">F.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Bell!&mdash;that may be my stepmother!
(<i>He quickly closes cupboard.</i>) We might go into the
other room. I call it my drawing-room, because there
is a piano and three gold-fish in a bowl.</p>


<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Stella</span> <i>goes into room</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p>Jack, in case she comes I&#8217;d better be off. Can you
lend me any cash?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> How much do you want? (<i>Producing
loose cash.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Two or three pounds. (<i>Looks in</i> <span class="smcap">Jack&#8217;s</span>
<i>hand</i>.) I&#8217;ll take four. (<i>Does so.</i>) Stop, I&#8217;ll give you
a duplicate key of the cupboard. (<i>Gives key.</i>) The
figure has got my black coat on, and I want it for
Brighton. When you come back, it will be wearing
<i>this</i> one. (<i>Pointing to coat he is wearing.</i>)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Explain that to Stella.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Right oh! (<span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>goes into drawing-room</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

please.</p>


<p class="center">(<i>He opens door wide, showing figure seated as before,
